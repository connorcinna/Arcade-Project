1. **DONE:** Downloaded skeleton code, made a main menu for the app, made classes for both games Sudoku and Snake, made a Snake class to represent the snake, drew the board for Snake, included the instructions for how to play Snake, created a Playable interface that both games implement that contains a single method play().

2. **TODO:** Make the snake move in the Snake game, create food, make snake grow bigger when it eats food, create win and lose conditions, create boundaries that the snake can't pass, do everything for sudoku

3. **PROB:** Changed some code and now the snake won't appear initially when the game starts, when it did before. Also, can't figure out how to make snake move.
